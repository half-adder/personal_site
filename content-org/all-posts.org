Hello -- I'm Sean, a PhD student at UNC Chapel Hill in the [[https://mckaylab.web.unc.edu][McKay Lab]]. I'm combining genetic analysis and genomics to study how organisms control gene expression to build themselves a body. Specifically, I am studying the famous [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycomb-group_proteins][Polycomb-group proteins]] and the chromatin structures that they regulate.

The field of chromatin biology is caught up in a bit of a debate right now.
