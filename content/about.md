Hello -- I'm Sean, a PhD student at UNC Chapel Hill in the [McKay Lab](https://mckaylab.web.unc.edu). I'm combining genetic analysis and genomics to study how organisms control gene expression to build themselves a body. Specifically, I am studying the famous [Polycomb-group proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycomb-group_proteins) and the chromatin structures that they regulate.
